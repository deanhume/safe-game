The friends need to learn to survive in a towering backyard that is now full of enormous predators. The players control ant-sized humans in backyard environments. From first- and third-person perspectives, players search for resources, craft weapons, build shelters, and battle realistic, over-sized insects. ",

In single player mode, players can only fight against giant insects. Damage is shown by a reduction in the health bar, with some green 'blood' coming from the insects. However, in multi-player mode it is possible for players to attack other human characters. While the violence is generally non-realistic looking, there are minor blood effects when humans attach each other.<br><br> A menu screen includes use of the word 'piss'. ",
