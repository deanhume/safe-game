    "contentIssues": "Crude Humor, Use of Alcohol, Violence On the open seas, players can engage in sea battles against other pirate ships by using cannons and harpoons; on land, players can use pistols and swords to battle enemies (e.g., skeletons, ghosts) in frenetic combat. Battles are highlighted by realistic gunfire, sword-slashing effects, and large explosions. During the course of the game, the players' character can drink mugs of grog, which can result in screen-blurring and the character belching and hiccupping. Consuming too much grog can cause the players' character to vomit green liquid. ",
