As players traverse side-scrolling environments, they solve puzzles and use a Spirit Flame light attack to defeat enemy creatures (e.g., slimes, birds, spiders).

    "contentIssues": "<strong>Mild Fantasy Violence</strong><br><br> This game feature flashy, over-the-top combat between fantasy characters. The violence found in this combat is unrealistic, as are reactions to it; enemies flash on being hit and disappear when defeated. Next to that, it also feature monsters and creatures with designs that would likely scare young children.",
