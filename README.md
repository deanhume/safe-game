# Xbox Age Advisor - Is this game safe for my child?

## Description

The goal of this project is to provide helpful information about whether a game is appropriate for a child. In a few clicks, you'll be able to gain useful insight into a PC or console game and determine: 

- If the title is age appropriate for the player
- Details of why a game is rated a certain way
- A rating summary (for example is there blood, violence, or language)
- Determine the age ratings for your own country (as these can differ from region to region)

This tool will automatically detect your country and provide appropriate rating details based on your local rating authority. The idea for this project is to create a safe and inclusive gaming experience for our children and arm parents/carers/guardians with insights to make a decision based on it.

## Problem

In a 2021 survey of 1000 odd parents of children who play video games, only 7% of parents understood what is perhaps the most important rating: E. This does stand for “Everyone,” but the rating actually means that it’s appropriate for children aged 6 and up.

Considering that this rating affects the youngest of possible gamers, it’s concerning to see how few parents understood the meaning. ​ Our primary objective with this project is to empower parents and caregivers, equipping them with the knowledge needed to make informed choices regarding the video games their children engage with. By doing so, we aim to create a safer and more inclusive gaming environment for our children.
